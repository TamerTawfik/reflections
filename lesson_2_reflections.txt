What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
i don't know what to say right now i should waite to figure out

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
it gives us some time and space so that we will be comfortable using it

Why and how or when?
god knows
